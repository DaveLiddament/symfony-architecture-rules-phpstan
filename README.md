# Symfony Architecture Rules for PHPStan

[![PHP versions: 8.3 to 8.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-8.3|8.4|8.5-blue.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/dave-liddament/symfony-architecture-rules-phpstan)

## The problem

Symfony doesn't tell you how to structure your application, so every team invents its own rules: "features don't
reach into each other's internals", "shared code doesn't depend on features", "services are stateless". Those rules
live in people's heads, in a wiki page, or in code review comments. As the app grows, they erode one shortcut at a
time, until nobody can say where anything belongs.

This [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org) extension turns those rules into errors. You get a sensible architecture out of
the box, every rule is configurable, and any part can be switched off.

It currently checks **[architectural boundaries](#architectural-boundaries)**: which parts of the app may depend on
which.

## Installation

```shell
composer require --dev dave-liddament/symfony-architecture-rules-phpstan
```

If you use [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) you're ready to go. Otherwise,
include the extension in your `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
includes:
    - vendor/dave-liddament/symfony-architecture-rules-phpstan/extension.neon
```

## Architectural boundaries

Code is split into four kinds of area:

| Area | Default namespace | What lives there |
|---|---|---|
| **Lib** | `Lib\` | Code you could take to another project. Any domain word disqualifies it. |
| **Shared** | `App\Shared\` | Application code used throughout the app, e.g. a `User` entity. Permanent. |
| **Nursery** | `App\Nursery\` | New code whose domain isn't clear yet. It moves into a domain once its home is obvious. |
| **Domain** | `App\<Name>\` | Every other namespace directly under `App\`, e.g. `App\Registration\`. |

A domain's root classes (`App\Registration\*`) are its public API. Everything in its subdirectories
(`App\Registration\Entity\*`) is internal to it. Classes directly in `App\` (e.g. `App\Kernel`) are framework glue
and are not checked, nor is `App\Tests\`.

| From ↓ / To → | Lib | Shared | Domain (public) | Domain (internal) | Nursery |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lib** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Shared** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Domain** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own domain only | ❌ |
| **Nursery** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

Dependencies flow one way: domains → Shared → Lib. Nothing may depend on the Nursery. When a domain needs a nursery
class, that's the signal to move it.

| Rule | Identifier | Reports |
|---|---|---|
| `LibIsolationRule` | `architecture.libIsolation` | Lib depending on application code |
| `SharedIsolationRule` | `architecture.sharedIsolation` | Shared depending on a domain or the Nursery |
| `DomainInternalRule` | `architecture.domainInternal` | A domain's internals used from another domain or the Nursery |
| `NurseryIsolationRule` | `architecture.nurseryIsolation` | A domain depending on the Nursery |

Every class name used in code is checked (type declarations, `new`, static calls, `instanceof`, `extends`,
attributes, ...). Class names that appear only in PHPDoc are not.

### Configuration

Defaults, which you can override in your `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
parameters:
    symfonyArchitecture:
        boundaries:
            enabled: true                    # false turns off all the boundary rules
            appNamespace: 'App'
            libNamespace: 'Lib'              # null turns off LibIsolationRule
            sharedNamespace: 'App\Shared'    # null turns off SharedIsolationRule
            nurseryNamespace: 'App\Nursery'  # null turns off NurseryIsolationRule
            ignoredNamespaces:
                - 'App\Tests'
```

- Shared and the Nursery can be any namespace, not just under `App\`. When one is `null`, its namespace becomes an
  ordinary domain.
- PHPStan merges lists with the defaults. To replace `ignoredNamespaces` instead, write `ignoredNamespaces!:`.
